**Overview:**
There are often times during an assessment when we may be limited to a Windows network and may not be able to use SSH for pivoting. 
We would have to use tools available for Windows operating systems in these cases. [SocksOverRDP](https://github.com/nccgroup/SocksOverRDP) is an example of a tool that uses `Dynamic Virtual Channels` (`DVC`) from the Remote Desktop Service feature of Windows. 
DVC is responsible for tunneling packets over the RDP connection. Some examples of usage of this feature would be clipboard data transfer and audio sharing. However, this feature can also be used to tunnel arbitrary packets over the network. We can use `SocksOverRDP` to tunnel our custom packets and then proxy through it. We will use the tool [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) as our proxy server.

---
start by downloading the appropriate binaries to our attack host to perform this attack. Having the binaries on our attack host will allow us to transfer them to each target where needed. We will need:

1. [SocksOverRDP x64 Binaries](https://github.com/nccgroup/SocksOverRDP/releases)
2. [Proxifier Portable Binary](https://www.proxifier.com/download/#win-tab)

- We can look for `ProxifierPE.zip`

We can then connect to the target using xfreerdp and copy the `SocksOverRDPx64.zip` file to the target. 
```
regsvr32.exe SocksOverRDP-Plugin.dll
```
From the Windows target load the SocksOverRDP.dll using regsvr32.exe.

connect to 172.16.5.19 over RDP using `mstsc.exe`, and we should receive a prompt that the SocksOverRDP plugin is enabled, and it will listen on 127.0.0.1:1080.

use the credentials `victor:pass@123` to connect to 172.16.5.19.

transfer SocksOverRDPx64.zip or just the SocksOverRDP-Server.exe to 172.16.5.19. We can then start SocksOverRDP-Server.exe with Admin privileges.

```
netstat -antb | findstr 1080
```
check active connections on the foothold target

After starting our listener, we can transfer Proxifier portable to the Windows 10 target (on the 10.129.x.x network), and configure it to forward all our packets to 127.0.0.1:1080. Proxifier will route traffic through the given host and port.

With Proxifier configured and running, we can start mstsc.exe, and it will use Proxifier to pivot all our traffic via 127.0.0.1:1080, which will tunnel it over RDP to 172.16.5.19, which will then route it to 172.16.6.155 using SocksOverRDP-server.exe.
