**Overview:**
There's an issue known as the "Double Hop" problem that arises when an attacker attempts to use Kerberos authentication across two (or more) hops. The issue concerns how Kerberos tickets are granted for specific resources. Kerberos tickets should not be viewed as passwords. They are signed pieces of data from the KDC that state what resources an account can access. When we perform Kerberos authentication, we get a "ticket" that permits us to access the requested resource (i.e., a single machine). On the contrary, when we use a password to authenticate, that NTLM hash is stored in our session and can be used elsewhere without issue.
The "Double Hop" problem often occurs when using WinRM/Powershell since the default authentication mechanism only provides a ticket to access a specific resource. This will likely cause issues when trying to perform lateral movement or even access file shares from the remote shell. In this situation, the user account being used has the rights to perform an action but is denied access. The most common way to get shells is by attacking an application on the target host or using credentials and a tool such as PSExec. In both of these scenarios, the initial authentication was likely performed over SMB or LDAP, which means the user's NTLM Hash would be stored in memory. Sometimes we have a set of credentials and are restricted to a particular method of authentication, such as WinRM, or would prefer to use WinRM for any number of reasons.

The crux of the issue is that when using WinRM to authenticate over two or more connections, the user's password is never cached as part of their login. 
A few workarounds for the double-hop issue are covered in [this post](https://posts.slayerlabs.com/double-hop/). We can use a "nested" `Invoke-Command` to send credentials (after creating a PSCredential object) with every request, so if we try to authenticate from our attack host to host A and run commands on host B, we are permitted
