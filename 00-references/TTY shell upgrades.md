| `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` | Spawns a shell via Python's pty module. Most reliable method where Python is available.     |
| `/bin/sh -i`                                     | Invokes sh in interactive mode directly. Simple but depends on shell flags being supported. |
| `perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'`                      | Spawns a shell by replacing the Perl process. Works where Perl is installed.                |
| `ruby: exec "/bin/sh"`                           | Replaces the Ruby process with a shell.                                                     |
| `lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')`                     | Runs a shell as a child process from Lua.                                                   |
| `awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'`                | Executes a shell via awk's system call. Useful when scripting languages are unavailable.    |
| `vim -c ':!/bin/sh'`                             | Drops into a shell from vim's command mode without exiting the editor.                      |
| `vim :set shell=/bin/sh :shell`                  | Sets the shell inside vim and opens it. Alternative vim method if `-c` is restricted.       |
