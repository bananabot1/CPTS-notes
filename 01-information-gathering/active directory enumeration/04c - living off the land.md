**Overview:**
several techniques for utilizing native Windows tools to perform our enumeration.
Let's assume our client has asked us to test their AD environment from a managed host with no internet access, and all efforts to load tools onto it have failed. Our client wants to see what types of enumeration are possible, so we'll have to resort to "living off the land" or only using tools and commands native to Windows/Active Directory. This can also be a more stealthy approach and may not create as many log entries and alerts as pulling tools into the network in previous sections. Most enterprise environments nowadays have some form of network monitoring and logging, including IDS/IPS, firewalls, and passive sensors and tools on top of their host-based defenses such as Windows Defender or enterprise EDR. Depending on the environment, they may also have tools that take a baseline of "normal" network traffic and look for anomalies. Because of this, our chances of getting caught go up exponentially when we start pulling tools into the environment from outside.
if the hosts are running an older version of PowerShell Notice the difference in the version reported. we have successfully downgrad the shell. Let's check and see if we are still writing logs. The primary place to look is in the `PowerShell Operational Log` found under `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational`. All commands executed in our session will log to this file. The `Windows PowerShell` log located at `Applications and Services Logs > Windows PowerShell` is also a good place to check

## Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

[Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/about-wmi) is a scripting engine that is widely used within Windows enterprise environments to retrieve information and run administrative tasks on local and remote hosts.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn`                              | Prints the patch level and description of the Hotfixes applied                                         |
| `wmic computersystem get Name,Domain,Manufacturer,Model,Username,Roles /format:List` | Displays basic host information to include any attributes within the list                              |
| `wmic process list /format:list`                                                     | A listing of all processes on host                                                                     |

## Net Commands

[Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/net-exe-2) commands can be beneficial to us when attempting to enumerate information from the domain. These commands can be used to query the local host and remote hosts, much like the capabilities provided by WMI. We can list information such as:

- Local and domain users
- Groups
- Hosts
- Specific users in groups
- Domain Controllers
- Password requirements

We'll cover a few examples below. Keep in mind that `net.exe` commands are typically monitored by EDR solutions and can quickly give up our location if our assessment has an evasive component. If you believe the network defenders are actively logging/looking for any commands out of the normal, you can try this workaround to using net commands. Typing `net1` instead of `net` will execute the same functions without the potential trigger from the net string.

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`net accounts`|Information about password requirements|
|`net accounts /domain`|Password and lockout policy|
|`net group /domain`|Information about domain groups|
|`net group "Domain Admins" /domain`|List users with domain admin privileges|
|`net group "domain computers" /domain`|List of PCs connected to the domain|
|`net group "Domain Controllers" /domain`|List PC accounts of domains controllers|
|`net group <domain_group_name> /domain`|User that belongs to the group|
|`net groups /domain`|List of domain groups|
|`net localgroup`|All available groups|
|`net localgroup administrators /domain`|List users that belong to the administrators group inside the domain (the group `Domain Admins` is included here by default)|
|`net localgroup Administrators`|Information about a group (admins)|
|`net localgroup administrators [username] /add`|Add user to administrators|
|`net share`|Check current shares|
|`net user <ACCOUNT_NAME> /domain`|Get information about a user within the domain|
|`net user /domain`|List all users of the domain|
|`net user %username%`|Information about the current user|
|`net use x: \computer\share`|Mount the share locally|
|`net view`|Get a list of computers|
|`net view /all /domain[:domainname]`|Shares on the domains|
|`net view \computer /ALL`|List shares of a computer|
|`net view /domain`|List of PCs of the domain|

## Dsquery

[Dsquery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732952\(v=ws.11\)) is a helpful command-line tool that can be utilized to find Active Directory objects. The queries we run with this tool can be easily replicated with tools like BloodHound and PowerView, but we may not always have those tools at our disposal, as discussed at the beginning of the section. But, it is a likely tool that domain sysadmins are utilizing in their environment. With that in mind, `dsquery` will exist on any host with the `Active Directory Domain Services Role` installed, and the `dsquery` DLL exists on all modern Windows systems by default now and can be found at `C:\Windows\System32\dsquery.dll`.

#### Dsquery DLL

All we need is elevated privileges on a host or the ability to run an instance of Command Prompt or PowerShell from a `SYSTEM`
```
dsquery user
```
```
dsquery computer
```
```
dsquery * "CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL"
use a [dsquery wildcard search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc754232\(v=ws.11\)) to view all objects in an OU```
```
 dsquery * -filter "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=32))" -attr distinguishedName userAccountControl
 looks for users with the `PASSWD_NOTREQD` flag set in the `userAccountControl` attribute.
```
```
dsquery * -filter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192)" -limit 5 -attr sAMAccountName
filter looks for all Domain Controllers in the current domain, limiting to five results.
```
### LDAP Filtering Explained

You will notice in the queries above that we are using strings such as `userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192`. These strings are common LDAP queries that can be used with several different tools too, including AD PowerShell, ldapsearch, and many others. Let's break them down quickly:

`userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:` Specifies that we are looking at the [User Account Control (UAC) attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/useraccountcontrol-manipulate-account-properties) for an object. This portion can change to include three different values we will explain below when searching for information in AD (also known as [Object Identifiers (OIDs)](https://ldap.com/ldap-oid-reference-guide/).  
`=8192` represents the decimal bitmask we want to match in this search. This decimal number corresponds to a corresponding UAC Attribute flag that determines if an attribute like `password is not required` or `account is locked` is set. These values can compound and make multiple different bit entries. Below is a quick list of potential values.

#### Logical Operators

When building out search strings, we can utilize logical operators to combine values for the search. The operators `&` `|` and `!` are used for this purpose. For example we can combine multiple [search criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/search-filter-syntax) with the `& (and)` operator like so:  
`(&(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=64))`

The above example sets the first criteria that the object must be a user and combines it with searching for a UAC bit value of 64 (Password Can't Change). A user with that attribute set would match the filter. You can take this even further and combine multiple attributes like `(&(1) (2) (3))`. The `!` (not) and `|` (or) operators can work similarly. For example, our filter above can be modified as follows:  
`(&(objectClass=user)(!userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=64))`
