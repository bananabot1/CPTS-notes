**Overview:**
- Automated process of systematically browsing a target website by following links and collecting data. Sends real HTTP requests, leaving traces in server logs.
- Extracts internal/external links, comments, metadata, and sensitive files (`.bak`, `.old`, `web.config`, `settings.php`, log files) that may expose credentials, API keys, or source code.
- `robots.txt` (site root) lists disallowed paths, often revealing hidden directories, admin panels, and backup files the owner wants excluded from search indexing.
- `/.well-known/` (RFC 8615) centralizes service metadata and configuration files. The `openid-configuration` URI is particularly useful for discovering authentication endpoints.
