**Overview:**
- FTP uses two separate TCP channels: a persistent control channel on port 21 for commands and status codes, and a data channel on port 20 opened only during transfers.
- In active mode the server initiates the data connection back to the client, which is almost always blocked by firewalls protecting the client side. Passive mode flips this: the server advertises a high port and the client connects to it, so the firewall sees only outbound traffic and lets it through
- TFTP is a stripped-down alternative using UDP instead of TCP, it has no authentication, no directory listing, and no session state, relying on the application layer to handle retransmission. 
- Both FTP and TFTP transmit everything in cleartext, including credentials. If attackers can position on the same network segment or intercept traffic, credentials are recoverable with a packet capture.
- vsFTPd is the default FTP server on most Linux distributions. its config at `/etc/vsftpd.conf` controls all behavior including anonymous access, write permissions, and chroot jails, making it the primary target for misconfiguration review.

## Enumeration

```
sudo nmap -sV -p21 --script ftp-anon <target>
```

Check for anonymous authentication on the target FTP service.

```
ftp <target>
nc -nv <target> 21
telnet <target> 21
```

Different ways to connect and banner-grab the FTP service.


```
openssl s_client -connect <target>:21 -starttls ftp
```

Interact with FTP over an encrypted connection using STARTTLS.

```
wget -m --no-passive ftp://<user>:<password>@<target>
```

Recursively download all accessible files from the target FTP server. `--no-passive` forces active mode.
