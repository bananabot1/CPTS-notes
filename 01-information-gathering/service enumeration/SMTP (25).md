**Overview:**
- SMTP is the standard protocol for sending emails between clients and servers, or between two mail servers. Operates on port 25 by default. Port 587 is used for authenticated client submission with STARTTLS, port 465 for implicit SSL/TLS.
- Transmits everything in plaintext unless STARTTLS or SSL/TLS is negotiated. ESMTP (the modern extension of SMTP) handles encryption via STARTTLS after the `EHLO` command, enabling AUTH PLAIN and other extensions safely.
- SMTP provides no reliable delivery confirmation and does not authenticate senders by default. This makes open relay misconfigurations a direct path to mail spoofing and spam abuse. SPF and DKIM are the primary mitigations deployed against this.
- The mail delivery chain goes: MUA (client) → MSA (submission/relay) → MTA (transfer) → MDA (delivery) → mailbox (POP3/IMAP). The MSA acts as the first validation checkpoint; if misconfigured as an open relay, it can be abused to send spoofed mail from arbitrary addresses.

## Dangerous Settings

```
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```

Configures the server as an open relay, allowing any host to send mail through it. Enables spoofed email injection and makes the server usable as a spam relay or for intercepting traffic between parties.

## Enumeration

```
sudo nmap <target> -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v
```

Test whether the target SMTP server is configured as an open relay using the `smtp-open-relay` NSE script.

```
telnet <target> 25
```

Connect directly to the SMTP service for manual enumeration.

## SMTP Commands

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`AUTH PLAIN`|Authenticates the client. Requires an encrypted connection to be safe|
|`HELO`|Initiates the session with the client's hostname|
|`EHLO`|Extended HELO. Used by ESMTP to negotiate extensions including STARTTLS|
|`MAIL FROM`|Specifies the sender address|
|`RCPT TO`|Specifies the recipient address|
|`DATA`|Begins email body transmission, terminated by a lone `.` on a line|
|`VRFY`|Checks whether a mailbox exists on the server. Often abused for user enumeration|
|`EXPN`|Expands a mailing list or alias to its members. Also useful for user enumeration|
|`RSET`|Aborts the current transaction without closing the connection|
|`NOOP`|Keeps the connection alive by requesting a server response|
|`QUIT`|Terminates the session|
