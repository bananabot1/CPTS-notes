**Overview:**
- MySQL is an open-source relational database management system developed by Oracle. Data is organized into schemas containing tables of rows and columns, queried and manipulated using SQL.
- Follows a client-server model. The MySQL server handles storage and query execution. Clients connect via TCP port 3306, either over an internal network or the public internet.
- Commonly deployed as part of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) or LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stacks, making it a frequent target in web application assessments.
- Errors returned by misconfigured web applications interacting with MySQL often leak query structure or schema details, providing a foothold for SQL injection.
