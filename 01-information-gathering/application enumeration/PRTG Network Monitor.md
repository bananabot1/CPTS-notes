**Overview:**
- PRTG Network Monitor is agentless network monitoring software used to monitor bandwidth, uptime, and collect statistics from routers, switches, servers, and more.
- Uses autodiscovery to scan network areas and build a device list, then gathers further data via ICMP, SNMP, WMI, NetFlow, and REST API.
- Frequently encountered during internal penetration tests.
- Versions before 18.2.39 are vulnerable to CVE-2018-9276, an authenticated command injection in the System Administrator web console.
