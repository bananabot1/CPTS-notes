- Nmap is an open-source network analysis and security auditing tool written in C, C++, Python, and Lua. It uses raw packets to identify live hosts, open ports, running services and versions, and operating systems.
- Common use cases: network mapping, firewall and IDS/IPS auditing, vulnerability assessment, penetration test simulation, and response analysis.
- Nmap offers multiple firewall and IDS/IPS evasion techniques including packet fragmentation, decoys, source IP spoofing, and source port manipulation.

## Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

 Firewalls inspect and filter packets based on configured rules. IDS scans for attack patterns and reports them. IPS extends IDS by actively blocking detected threats based on signature matching.
The TCP ACK scan (`-sA`) is harder to filter than SYN or connect scans because it sends only the ACK flag, which many firewalls and IDS/IPS treat as established-connection traffic.

```
sudo nmap <target> -p <port> -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5
```

SYN scan using random decoys to obscure the real source. Decoys work with SYN, ACK, ICMP, and OS detection scans.

```
sudo nmap <target> -n -Pn -p <port> -O -S <spoofed-ip> -e tun0
```

OS detection scan using a spoofed source IP (Nmap uses this address as the apparent source of the scan packets, instead of the real attack host). `-S` sets the source IP, `-e` specifies the interface.

---
## Source Port Evasion Flow

 DNS servers are often more trusted by firewalls than arbitrary external hosts. Using `TCP port 53` as a source port can cause firewall rules and IDS/IPS filters to treat packets as legitimate DNS traffic and pass them through.

```
sudo nmap <target> -p <port> -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
```

SYN scan against a filtered port to confirm its state.

```
sudo nmap <target> -p <port> -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace --source-port 53
```

Repeat using source port `53` to bypass firewall rules trusting DNS traffic.

```
ncat -nv --source-port 53 <target> <port>
```

Connect to the filtered port using source port `53` once the firewall is confirmed to accept it.
